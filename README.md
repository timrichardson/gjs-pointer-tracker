# Pointer Tracker

This GNOME extension can highlight the mouse pointer to improve visibility on screencasts.
Optionally, mouse clicks can cause a secondary highlight.

## Installation

### Recommended: GNOME extensions website

Visit the [GNOME extensions website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7645/pointer-tracker/).

### From source

```
git clone https://github.com/garzj/gjs-pointer-tracker
cd gjs-pointer-tracker
yarn

gnome-session-quit --logout # restart GNOME
```

## Development

In the nested shell, click to confirm the tracker still shows click feedback.
